# algorithm
ALL the algorithms are from Prof Huang's algorithm class projects in OSU.

*** Search algorithms ***

1. quick_select.py: 
O(n)
Choosing kth smallest number from the array.

2. quick_sort_tree.py:
a. genereate binary search tree with using quick sort algorihtm 
b. decode binary search tree to a list
c. search and insert operation implementation

*** Divid n Conquer ***

3. merge_sort.py
O(nlogn)
Sort the array with using merge sort algorithm. 

4. num_inversions.py
O(nlogn)
Counting the number of inversed letters in an array. (Similar algorithm to merge sort.)

5. longest_path.py
O(n)
Find the longest path of a tree. Empty tree is 0. A tree like [[[],1,[]], 2, [[],3,[]]] is 2 (1->2->3).
